# Damney AI (Android App)

This package contains the files used to power your Damney AI mobile assistant.

## What's Inside
- `damney_ai_app.py`: The Streamlit app that powers your AI assistant.
- `index.html`: A placeholder home page if using a WebView.
- `README.txt`: You're reading it!

## How to Turn This Into an APK

1. **Using WebView App Builder (No Code)**
   - Go to https://gonative.io or https://webintoapp.com
   - Upload your Streamlit web app URL (or localhost:8501 if using phone server)
   - Customize your icon, splash, etc.
   - Download your APK

2. **Advanced: Build using Android Studio**
   - Create a WebView app project
   - Load `index.html` or point to your hosted Streamlit app
   - Bundle assets and export as APK
